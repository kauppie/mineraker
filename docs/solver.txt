This algorithm could be performed between any two tiles, but for performance
reasons, only nearby tiles should be considered. 
The algorithm can be used to find mines and possible locations for mines.


flagging/mine search algorithm begin

for tile in tiles:

if tile is open and number:

neighbours = not flagged tile's neighbours

for neighbour in neighbours:

tile_flag_value = tile.value - tile.flags_around
neighbour_flag_value = neighbour.value - neighbour.flags_around

if neighbour is open and number and tile_flag_value > neighbour_flag_value:

diff = set_difference(tile.neighbours, neighbour.neighbours)

diff_mines = tile_flag_value - neighbour_flag_value
if diff.size == diff_mines:

-> diff elements must be mines

elif diff.size > diff_mines:

-> mines are in some permutation in these tiles?

algorithm end


empty search algorithm begin

for tile in tiles:

if tile is open and number:

neighbours = not flagged tile's neighbours

for neighbour in neighbours:

tile_flag_value = tile.value - tile.flags_around
neighbour_flag_value = neighbour.value - neighbour.flags_around

if 
neighbour is open and number and 
tile_flag_value == neighbour_flag_value and 
tile.neighbours.size > neighbour.neighbours.size and
tile.neighbours includes neighbours.neighbours:

diff = set_difference(tile.neighbours, neighbour.neighbours)

-> diff elements must be empties

TODO: IMPLEMENT algorithm

tile indexes and mine count in some permutation in them:

if 
tile.neighbours includes said [tile indexes] and
[mine count] == tile.value:
-> open difference(tile.neighbours, [tile indexes])

not opened and not flagged neighbours
tile's actual value - amount of flagged neighbours
